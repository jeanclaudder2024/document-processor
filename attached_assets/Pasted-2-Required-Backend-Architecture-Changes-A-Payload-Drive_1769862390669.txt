2. Required Backend Architecture Changes
A. Payload-Driven Data Fetching

Update the document processing flow so that:

The request payload may include:

{
  "vessel_id": 12,
  "buyer_id": "uuid",
  "seller_id": "uuid",
  "product_id": "uuid",
  "refinery_id": "uuid",
  "buyer_bank_id": "uuid",
  "seller_bank_id": "uuid",
  "departure_port_id": 45,
  "destination_port_id": 78,
  "broker_id": "uuid",
  "deal_id": "uuid"
}


For each ID present:

Query the correct table

Fetch exactly one record

Store it in a structured dictionary (e.g. data["buyer"], data["product"])

3. Prefix-Based Placeholder Mapping (MANDATORY)

Implement strict prefix logic based on the following mapping:

Prefix	Table
vessel_	vessels
port_	ports
departure_port_	ports
destination_port_	ports
company_	companies
buyer_	buyer_companies
seller_	seller_companies
refinery_	refineries
product_	oil_products
broker_	broker_profiles
buyer_bank_	buyer_company_bank_accounts
seller_bank_	seller_company_bank_accounts

The system must never mix prefixes or data sources.

4. Placeholder Detection Rules

Detect placeholders in Word documents using these formats:

{{placeholder}}
{placeholder}
[[placeholder]]
%placeholder%
<placeholder>


Normalize placeholders by:

Lowercasing

Removing spaces, dashes, underscores

Example:

{{Buyer Bank Swift}} → buyerbankswift
{{buyer_bank_swift}} → buyerbankswift

5. Placeholder Replacement Logic

For each detected placeholder:

Identify its prefix (e.g. buyer_bank_)

Match it to the correct dataset already fetched

Replace it only if the matching data exists

If the value is:

NULL → replace with empty string

array → join with commas

Never generate random data if an ID was provided

Fallback generation is allowed only if no ID exists in the payload

6. Bank Account Logic (Critical)

If buyer_bank_id or seller_bank_id is provided:

Fetch that exact record

Otherwise:

Fetch the bank account where is_primary = true

7. Code Quality & Safety

Prevent KeyErrors when placeholders exist but IDs were not sent

Do not overwrite placeholders from another table

Make the system scalable to 500+ placeholders

Keep logic modular (fetch_*, replace_placeholders)

8. Final Goal

When a Word template is uploaded:

90%+ of placeholders must be replaced directly from Supabase

All replaced data must come from the same records (same IDs)

No cross-entity contamination (buyer data never appears in seller fields)

Please refactor the backend accordingly and confirm when:

Multi-table fetching is ID-based

Placeholder replacement is prefix-safe

The API is ready for production document generation

This API is used for commercial maritime documents, so correctness and data integrity are mandatory
